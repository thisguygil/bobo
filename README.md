## Supported sources and formats for music
Bobo IS SUPPOSED to support all sources and formats supported by [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer#supported-formats):
### Sources
* YouTube
* SoundCloud
* Bandcamp
* Vimeo
* Twitch streams
* Local files
* HTTP URLs
### Formats
* MP3
* FLAC
* WAV
* Matroska/WebM (AAC, Opus or Vorbis codecs)
* MP4/M4A (AAC codec)
* OGG streams (Opus, Vorbis and FLAC codecs)
* AAC streams
* Stream playlists (M3U and PLS)

While many file formats work, I have quite literally no idea how to make some of the sources work.
